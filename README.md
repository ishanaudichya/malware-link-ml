This project uses machine learning techniques to classify URLs as either malware or phishing based on the Malware URL dataset from Kaggle. We employ various Python libraries, including scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Seaborn, to perform data preprocessing, token analysis, and model training. In the end, we evaluate and showcase the model's accuracy.

## Data Cleaning

The first step is to clean and preprocess the dataset. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting the data into a format suitable for machine learning.

## Common Tokens Analysis

We analyze the dataset to identify common tokens in the URLs. This analysis can provide insights into the characteristics of malware and phishing URLs.

### Visualization with Word Cloud

We visualize the common tokens using a word cloud to gain a better understanding of the data. Word clouds provide a visual representation of the most frequent words or tokens in the dataset.


## Model Training

We train several machine learning models to classify URLs, including:

1. XGBoost
2. LightGBM
3. Random Forest Classifier

The accuracy of each model is displayed while running, allowing you to assess their performance.

### Running the Models

To train and evaluate the models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/malware-phishing-detection.git
   cd malware-phishing-detection


2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook malware_detection.ipynb
or
    ```bash
      python malware_detection.py

4. View the model's accuracy and performance on the dataset.

## Testing the Model
After training, you can test the models with your own URLs to determine if they are classified as malware or phishing.
